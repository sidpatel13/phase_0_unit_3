### Reflection
What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
I just did some preliminary reading before I started the exercise and that helped out a ton when going through this challenge. Some of the problems in sum and count and joins were a little difficult but once I did some research on my own, I was able to figure it out.


What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
I had questions like how to join tables. I did some google searches and looked at other examples of how tables were joined.

What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
Yes, I got a much better understanding of sql. I learned about sql joins. How to return subsets of a larger dataset.

Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
Yes, I learned how to join tables by matching the id of the table you are joining with the table you are joining it for.

How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
Very confident.

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
I really enjoyed writing queries myself.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
It was a bit tedious when you canâ€™t get your query to work and have to do additional research.
