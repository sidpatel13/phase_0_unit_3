## Release 4: Design your own Schema
Description of what you're modeling: 
For one to one, Iâ€™m modeling the relationship between people and their social security numbers to their benefits. Everyone has one social security number that they are connected to.

For many to many, I am modeling the relationship between people, books, and their library card. The library card is connected to both the books you get and who you are so it can identify your information.
